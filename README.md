# FALSB
The Fair Adversarial Learning Strategies Benchmark was implemented for my master's research project aiming to compare the following adversarial strategies for fairness in machine learning:

* [Learning Adversarially Fair and Transferable Representations](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/madras18a.html) (**note**: part of our code was implemented using their [repository](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/laftr))
* [Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3278721.3278779)
* [Data Decisions and Theoretical Implications when Adversarially Learning Fair Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00075)
* [FairGAN: Fairness-aware Generative Adversarial Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622525)
* [FairGAN+: Achieving Fair Data Generation and Classification through Generative Adversarial Nets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006322)
