# FALSB
The Fair Adversarial Learning Strategies Benchmark was implemented for my master's research project aiming to compare the following adversarial strategies for fairness in machine learning:

* [Learning Adversarially Fair and Transferable Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06309) (**note**: part of our code was implemented using their [repository](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/laftr))
* [Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3278721.3278779)
